I just implemented the 2D selective filter<sup>1</sup> in Palabos. Because of the non-local calculation when filtering the collision operator, it takes Miguel and me some time to think about a way to implement it in Palabos. 

- We first thought about the `integrateProcessingFunctional` but it might only do the post-collision operation (though we could apply a -1 `level` and call `executeInternalProcessors(-1)` manually). 

- Then Miguel found the *DynamicProcessor* could be a candidate,something in *src/basicDynamics/dynamicsProcessorXD.hh* where there is `ExternalRhoJcollideAndStream2D` for external macroscopic variable cases (*examples/codesByTopic/externalMacroscopicVariables*). 

- I then found the `nonLocalDynamicsXD` written in *src/core/nonLocalDynamicsXD.h/hh*. This doesn't seems to be complete and neither is there a show case. However, you can find something related in `ExecuteNonLocalDynamics3D`, a functional inherited from `BoxProcessingFunctional3D_L` in *src/boundaryCondition/NLD_boundaries3D.h/hh*. 

I finally decide to go to the last direction because I consider `nonLocalDynamicsXD` as a good interface to start with. So, the basic idea here is to keep every variables and function of the dynamics in the `dynamics` class and create each member function a functional for data processor. Likely, I write `SelectiveFilterBGKDynamics2D.nonLocalAction()` and `SelectiveFilterBGKDynamics2D.prepareFNeq()` and two functional inherited from `BoxProcessingFunctional2D_L`. In addition, the dynamics class has two private members for the original and the filtered $f_{neq}$. `applyProcessingFunctional` would be used in the main function.

Another important thing I found when writing a new dynamics is about the `serialize` and `unserialize`. It is extremely importantto deal with the additional allocated data (member variables) in the dynamics using `serializer.addValues()` and `unserializer.readValues()`. Otherwise, one will run into problems when running the program with multiple cores. I found [this article](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/serialization) helpful talking about serialization and unserialization. In general, serialization helps flatten the objects so that make non built-in data type transmittable.
