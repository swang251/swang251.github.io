The details within the instrument is more and more revealed recently thanks to the study by different researchers, like A. Hirschberg, B. Fabre, M. P. Verge, to name a few, even though there are still many puzzles left to be solved.</p><p>In general, the air blown out of the player's mouth passes through a flue channel, either a flue canal of a recorder or the one constrained by the player's lip, and forms a jet. The jet starts to oscillate with transverse perturbations contributed either by the acoustic field feed-back, the jet's intrinsic instability or the hydrodynamic direct feedback from the labium. Such an oscillation or perturbation will evolve and grow while convected by the jet from the flue channel exit toward the labium (a sharp edge). The jet will then hit the labium and apply a force on it, and the reacting force from the labium to the fluid acts as the acoustic source that sustains the acoustic oscillation inside the flute.</p><h2 id="the-flute-model">The Flute Model</h2><p>Based on the sound generation mechanisms, there are several key components need to be modeled and the most popular and easiest way to do that is modeling each component separately and lump them together. Such a lumped model is widely applied in different studies as well as synthesis, even though questioned by some researchers (Fabre et al. 2000).</p><p>Here is a list of the components to be modeled:</p><ul><li>Jet formation</li><li>Jet receptivity</li><li>Jet instability</li><li>Sound source</li><li>Vortices</li><li>Turbulence</li></ul><h2 id="the-jet-formation">The Jet Formation</h2><ul><li>The flow passes from the player's mouth or the organ's foot through the lip or flue channel.

(Theory of Vortex Sound)</em></p></blockquote></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy">Enthalpy</a>: &quot;is defined as the sum of the system's internal energy and the product of its pressure and volume. The pressure-volume term expresses the work required to establish the system's physical dimensions, i.e. to make room for it by displacing its environment.&quot; <em>Enthalpy = internal energy + work required to establish the system's physical dimensions.</em></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagnation_enthalpy">Total Enthalpy</a>: <span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle B = \int\dfrac{dp}{\rho} + \dfrac{1}{2}v^2\)</span></li><li>It is IMPORTANT to notice the following things:<ol type="1"><li>Originally proposed by Powell, the vortex sound equation is a reformation of the Lighthill's equation, which means it is applied to the <strong>unbounded homentropic flow</strong>.</li><li>It is based on the <strong>low Mach number approximation</strong></li><li>The term <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\cdot(\rho_0\boldsymbol{\omega}\times \boldsymbol{v})\)</span> is the <strong>dominant component of the Lighthill quadrupole</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\dfrac{\partial^2(\rho v_iv_j)}{\partial x_i\partial x_j}\)</span></li></ol></li></ul></li></ul><p>By the way,</p><ul><li>The equations in the wave equation format, i.e., Lighthill's equation and the vortex sound is derived by combining the continuity equation and the momentum equation.</li><li>Crocc's equation is simply the <strong>Crocco's form</strong> of the <strong>momentum equation</strong> with the emphasis on the vorticity.</li></ul><h2 id="dissipative-vortices">Dissipative Vortices</h2><p>Now, let's see why the vortices are acoustical dissipative as well.</p><p>In general, it is because</p><blockquote><p>acoustic energy is expended in the generation of vorticity at an edge or corner, and the mean flow convects away the vorticity into regions where it can no longer continue to interact significantly with the acoustic field, and where its kinetic energy is ultimately dissipated as heat.</p></blockquote><ul><li>Based on Howe, M. (1980), the absorbed acoustic energy is written as <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\displaystyle\pi_T = \int\rho_0\boldsymbol{\omega}\times\boldsymbol{u&#39;} \text{d}^3\boldsymbol{x} = -\int\varepsilon_{ij}\rho_0v_iv_j \text{d}^3\boldsymbol{x}\end{equation}\]</span><ul><li>where <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{u&#39;}\)</span> is the <em>acoustic</em> particle velocity, <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{v}\)</span> is the velocity and <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{ij}\)</span> is the <em>acoustic</em> rate of the strain tensor</li></ul></li></ul><p>As you might have noticed, the term (1) <span class="math inline">\(\rho_0\boldsymbol{\omega}\times\boldsymbol{u&#39;}\)</span> resembles the term <span class="math inline">\(\rho_0\boldsymbol{\omega}\times\boldsymbol{v}\)</span> in the vortex sound equation, only by replacing <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{v}\)</span> with the acoustic counterpart <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{u}&#39;\)</span>. The term (2) <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_{ij}\rho_0v_iv_j\)</span> is also simply the product of the low Mach number Lighthill stress tensor <span class="math inline">\(\rho_0v_iv_j\)</span> and the acoustic rate of the strain tensor.</p><p>For both term (1) and (2), their counterparts in the generative case correspond to source term or RHS of the vortex sound equation and the Lighthill's equation, which describe the energy transfering from the fludic field to the acoustic field. Instead, term (1) and (2) is the other way round, the energy goes from the acoustic field to the fluidic field, or in other words, the acoustic energy is dissipated.</p><p>Actually, there is another way to understand quickly the dissipative characteristic of the vortex.</p><p>The velocity is related to the scalar potention <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> and the stream function <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{A}\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}\boldsymbol{v} = \nabla\phi + \nabla\times\boldsymbol{A}\end{equation}\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\phi = \boldsymbol{u}\)</span> is the irrotational field and the <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\times\boldsymbol{A}\)</span> is the solenoidal field.</p><p>The acoustic field is irrotational as <span class="math inline">\(u&#39; = \nabla\phi&#39;\)</span>. The vorticity field is solenoidal as <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\omega} = \nabla\times \boldsymbol{v} =\nabla\times \nabla\times \boldsymbol{v}\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(\nabla(\nabla\times f) = \nabla\times(\nabla f) = 0\)</span>.</p><p>When the kinetic energy is conserved, it simply flows from <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\times\boldsymbol{A}\)</span> (solenoidal/vorticity) to the <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\phi\)</span> (irrotational/acoustic) when the sound is generated and the other way round when the sound is dissipated.</p><h2 id="reference">Reference</h2><ul><li>[1] Howe, M.

This is something that all the Palabos community used to looking forward and makes it easier for the users to get official updates and contribute their own code. Personally, I would like to build my own Palabos version with in-house developed code while keeping updated from the official one. In this post, I am trying to talk about the Git workflow I use, which is mainly based on the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow">Feature Branch Workflow</a> and the <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Git Workflow</a>. <img src="/images/20191217/PalabosGitFlow.jpg" /> <span id="more"></span></p><h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2><p>The workflow has to at least fulfill the following requirements.</p><ul><li>Allow private development: researchers might want to develop and test their own algorithms on Palabos. Some of the algorithms may not have been published yet. It is therefore reasonable to keep the repository private.</li><li>Allow easy merge requests: This is about implementations of published algorithms or some complement functions/dataProcessors that should definitely be contributed to the official Palabos version.</li><li>Allow updates from the UniGeSPC/Palabos: keep the personal repository up-to-date with the official one.</li><li>Allow bug fixed both committed to the private and the official repositories.</li></ul><h2 id="forked-project">Forked Project</h2><ul><li>Firstly, <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/fork-project.html">fork</a> the project <a href="https://gitlab.com/unigespc/palabos">UniGeSPC/palabos</a>. After this, you could find the folked project under <em>Projects--&gt;Your Projects</em></li><li>Private Project? :<ul><li><strong>Initial solution</strong><em>: Go to your forked Palabos project. You can make it private by set the Project visibility to </em>private<em>. (Go to </em>Setting --&gt; General --&gt; Visibility, project features, permissions --&gt; Project visibility*)</li><li>The above solution simply doesn't work as GitLab (at least the project with CI/CD) requires the forked project to be public or you have to be a member of the <code>UniGeSPC/Palabos</code>, in order to automatically merge the branch.</li><li>The <strong>Current Possible Solution</strong> (I haven't tried it myself) would be:<ul><li>forked from <code>UniGeSPC/palabos</code> as a public repository under the namespace A</li><li>Create A Group B (with the namespace B)</li><li>For your <code>A/palabos</code> into namespace B as <code>B/palabos</code> as a private repository.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="branches">Branches</h2><p>There are four kinds of branches:</p><h3 id="master-branch">Master branch</h3><p>The <strong>master</strong> branch is simply used to save a copy of the <strong>UniGeSPC/palabos/master</strong>. Whenever this is a new release/update from the upstream, it should be merged to the <strong>master</strong> branch which is then merged to the <strong>develop</strong> branch.</p><p>As our own Palabos project is forked from the <strong>UniGeSPC/palabos</strong>, when we first clone the GitLab repository, our <strong>master</strong> branch should be synchronized with the <strong>UniGeSPC/palabos/master</strong>.</p><p>In order to track the official Palabos project, we need to add the <strong>UniGeSPC/palabos</strong> as the upstream <figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ git remote add upstream https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;unigespc&#x2F;palabos.git</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure> The upstream repository is shown when typing <figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ git remote -v</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure> As only the master branch of the upstream repository matters, I modified my <em>.git/config</em> so that whenever I call <code>git fetch</code>, it only fetches the <strong>master</strong> branch instead of all branches. <figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">[remote &quot;upstream&quot;]</span><br><span class="line">        url &#x3D; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;unigespc&#x2F;palabos.git</span><br><span class="line">        fetch &#x3D; +refs&#x2F;heads&#x2F;master:refs&#x2F;remotes&#x2F;upstream&#x2F;master</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>When there is a new release in the upstream, fetch it and merge it into <strong>master</strong> <figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ git fetch upstream master</span><br><span class="line">$ git checkout master</span><br><span class="line">$ git merge upstream&#x2F;master</span><br><span class="line">$ git push origin master</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure> The <strong>master</strong> branch is then merged to the <strong>develop</strong> branch that is introduced later. <figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ git checkout develop</span><br><span class="line">$ git merge --no-ff master</span><br><span class="line">$ git push origin develop</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><h3 id="develop-branch">Develop branch</h3><p>The <strong>develop</strong> branch is used for the development, including new features or algorithms.

This avoids losing information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature.</p></blockquote><h3 id="feature-branch">Feature branch</h3><p>The <strong>feature</strong> branch is used for both algorithm implementations and new functions/dataProcessors. It can be used for implementing both published and unpublished algorithms. The <strong>feature</strong> branch has a name convention <strong>feature-</strong>*. Whenever starting a new <strong>feature</strong>, it should be branched off from either the <strong>master</strong> branch or the <strong>develop</strong> branch.</p><p>When you want to implement an algorithm that would be contributed to the upstream Palabos repository, you should branch off the <strong>master</strong> branch: <figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ git checkout -b feature-DESCRIPTION master</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure> Otherwise, you should branch off the <strong>develop</strong> branch: <figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ git checkout -b feature-DESCRIPTION develop</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>When the development of a new feature is done and tested, it should be merged to the <strong>develop</strong> branch. <figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ git checkout develop</span><br><span class="line">$ git merge --no-ff feature-DESCRIPTION</span><br><span class="line">$ git push origin develop</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>If you want to <a href="https://gitlab.com/unigespc/palabos/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribute</a> this new feature to Palabos, you can create a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-merge-request.html"><code>merge request</code></a>.</p><p>You can also delete this branch once it is merged to both the <strong>develop</strong> branch and the official Palabos. <figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ git branch -d feature-DESCRIPTION</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><h3 id="bugfix-branch">bugFix branch</h3><p><strong>bugFix</strong> is used to fix bugs. It is suggested to open an issue for each bug your find. It could then be branched off from <strong>develop</strong> <figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ git checkout -b bugFix-issueX develop</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure> Once the bug is fixed, it should be merged back to the <strong>develop</strong> branch <figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ git checkout develop</span><br><span class="line">$ git merge --no-ff bugFix-issueX</span><br><span class="line">$ git push origin develop</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure> However, the Palabos Group might also fix the bug in the upstream branches if you don't create a <code>merge request</code> for your <strong>bugFix</strong> branch. If this happens, you might have to solve the conflict manually when you fetch <strong>upstream/master</strong> into the local <strong>master</strong> and then merged to the <strong>develop</strong>.</p><h2 id="cicd">CI/CD</h2><p>The palabos repository has CI/CD to make it easier for integrating and testing the codes from different contributors. In general:</p><ul><li>GitLab CI/CD is configured by a file called <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code>. You can find it in the palabos root directory.</li><li><code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> defines the <strong>pipelines</strong> to be done.</li><li><strong><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/index.html">Pipelines</a></strong> is composed of<ul><li><strong>jobs</strong>: i.e., what to do (compiling, testing, etc.),</li><li><strong>Stages:</strong>: i.e., when to do.</li></ul></li><li>Jobs are excuted by <strong><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/README.html">Runners</a></strong></li></ul><p>I am totally new to CI/CD but only few things we need to do in order to make a successful merge request:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/README.html">Configuring GitLab Runner</a>: under project --&gt; <strong>Settings</strong> --&gt; <strong>CI/CD</strong> --&gt; <strong>Runners</strong> --&gt; <strong>Ennable shared Runners</strong>.</li><li>Then done! Once you've pushed your code to the repository, the pipeline will be automatically run.</li></ul><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Generally, this framework should work for most of our daily development and usage based on Palabos. My main doubt now is about the <strong>master</strong> branch. As it does nothing but saving a copy of the upstream, it seems reasonablbe to remove it. Everytime we see an new release from the upstream, the <strong>upstream/master</strong> could be directly merged in to the <strong>develop</strong> branch. However, the <strong>master</strong> branch is still kept for now to make the structure clearer.</p><p>Even though the workflow is not perfect, it allows us to maintain a customized Palabos while keeping the repository up-to-date with the upstream official Palabos. It is also easy to contribute to Palabos if you want. The flow diagram showed at the beginning is made based on <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Vincent Driessen</a>'s template. Don't be hesitate to leave a message if you have any comments or suggestions. Thank you.</p>]]></content>

IBM is applied in the context of lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for the first time in 2004 by Feng and Michaelides (Feng and Michaelides, J. Comput. Phys, 2004). People also call such combination immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM). In Palabos, different off-lattice methods have been implemented, including the Filippo-Hanel method, the Guo-Zheng-Shi method, the Bouzidi method and also the IBM.</p><span id="more"></span><p>In Palabos, there is a demo showing how to use the IBM to solve the moving wall problems (<em>example/showCases/movingWall</em>). As one can notice, in Palabosv2.0r0, only 3D IBM is implemented and the corresponding implementaions can be found in</p><ul><li><em>src/offLattice/immersedWalls3D.h</em></li><li><em>src/offLattice/immersedWalls3D.hh</em></li></ul><p>Here I will discuss only how the method used in the showCase works.</p><p>In the moving wall case, the multi direct-forcing IB-LBM proposed by Inamuro (2012) is used. Two main function are used:</p><ul><li><code>instantiateImmersedWallData(vertices, areas, container)</code> for the wall boundary instantiation,</li><li><code>inamuroIteration(parameters)</code> for the main IBM iteration.</li></ul><h3 id="instantiateimmersedwalldata">InstantiateImmersedWallData</h3><p><code>instantiateImmersedWallData</code> is a function wrapper for the functional <code>instantiateImmersedWallData3D</code> where the boundary data is stored in a container block called <code>ImmersedWallData3D</code>.</p><h3 id="inamuroiteration">InamuroIteration</h3><p><code>inamuroIteration</code> is a function wrapper for the functional <code>InamuroIteration3D</code> which implements the IB-LBM algorithm following Inamuro (2012). In Inamuro's paper, there are 5 steps (from Step 0-5) in the iterative procedure and it iterate from Step 1 to Step 4.

      &lt;p&gt;The immersed boundary method (IBM) is proposed by Peskin in 1972 in his Ph.D. thesis and then is widely used for complex boundaries and moving boundary problems. IBM is applied in the context of lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for the first time in 2004 by Feng and Michaelides (Feng and Michaelides, J. Comput. Phys, 2004). People also call such combination immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM). In Palabos, different off-lattice methods have been implemented, including the Filippo-Hanel method, the Guo-Zheng-Shi method, the Bouzidi method and also the IBM.&lt;/p&gt;
